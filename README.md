### Useful resources

There are a couple of sources I found helpful while working on this project:

- [Form Validation UX in HTML and CSS](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-ux-html-css/) - This is a good memo of HTML attributes and CSS selectors for form validation.
- [Form validation helper](https://github.com/thomasjbradley/form-validation-helper) - This is a very useful and easy solution for form validation, it helps prevent the :invalid/:valid styles from showing until after the form has been submitted.
